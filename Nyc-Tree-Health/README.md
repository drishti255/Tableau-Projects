## What's This About?

You've probably heard the saying "Money doesn't grow on trees." But I wanted to see if there's actually a connection between neighborhood wealth and how healthy the street trees are.

Using real data from NYC's 2015 Tree Census, I created a Tableau dashboard that compares tree health in the richest and poorest zipcodes across all five boroughs.

**The Question:** Do wealthier neighborhoods have healthier trees?

---

## What I Found

**Surprising discovery:** More money doesn't always mean healthier trees!

- **Queens** (median income: $130K) has **86% of trees in good health**
- **Manhattan** (median income: $250K - the richest!) only has **81% of trees in good health**
- Even though Manhattan is almost twice as wealthy, Queens actually has healthier street trees

**What this tells us:** Tree health isn't just about neighborhood wealth. Other factors like community care, tree maintenance programs, or environmental conditions might matter more than income alone.

## The Data

I worked with three datasets:

**1. NYC Tree Census (2015)**
- How healthy each tree is (Good, Fair, or Poor)
- What kind of tree it is
- Where it's located (zipcode and borough)

**2. NYC Income Data (2015)**
- How much money households make in each zipcode
- Which zipcodes are richest and poorest

**3. Tree Species Info**
- Extra details about each tree type

All data is free and public from NYC Open Data!

## Tools I Used

- **Tableau Desktop** - to create the visualizations
- **Excel/CSV files** - to organize the data

## Project Files

- `Tree___Money_Analysis.twb` - The Tableau workbook
- `data/` - All three CSV files
  - `tree-census-NYC_2015.csv`

## What I Might Add Later

- Compare different years if I find more data
- Add other factors like population density or air quality
- Look at specific tree species patterns
